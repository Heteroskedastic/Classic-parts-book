# Classic Parts Book maker

The purpose of theis project is to build an open source app that will allow a user to upload a pdf of an old parts book. 
(I am thinking vintage motorcycle) And create image map with a list of part. Basiclly create a digital Microfische parts catalog based on the PDF.

A great example would be to make something like this based on the uploaded PDF.
